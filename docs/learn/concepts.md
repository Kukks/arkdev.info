## üï¥Ô∏è Actors

### ASP

Ark Service Providers, or **ASPs** in short, are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similar to how Lightning service providers work. The ASP is responsible for creating new [VTXOs](#vtxo) and broadcasting the [Round transactions](#round-transaction) and it's incentivized by the fees charged on the virtual UTXOs created. Each of these rounds expire after a certain period of time, to allow ASP to reclaim the Bitcoin liquidity locked on-chain, unless the user decides to refresh their VTXOs and pay the liquidity provider fees again.

### Users

**Users** are the ones who sends and receive VTXOs, virtual UTXOs that can be transformed in UTXO at any time, but are kept off-chain for cheaper and faster settlements of Bitcoin payments. They can unilaterally exit their funds from the Ark to the mainchain without asking the ASP for permission, assuming the cost of the on-chain transaction to exit is not greater than the value of the VTXO being spent.

## ‚è∞ Moments

### Boarding the Ark

When a User sends funds to the Ark and gets VTXOs in return.

### Unilateral exit

When a user decides to withdraw his funds from the Ark to mainchain, without asking the ASP for permission.

### Round

Periodic transaction crafted by the ASP that hits mainchain and creates new VTXOs.

## üìù Contracts and Primitives
:::note
All time periods used on timelocks (**5s**, **24h**, **4w**, **1y**) are arbitrary: each ASP can use different values.

### VTXO

A Virtual UTXO or VTXO in short, it's a Bitcoin transaction output that can be spent off-chain and can be redeemed on-chain at any time. The VTXO is the leaf of the [VTXO tree](#vtxo-tree) commited by the [Shared Output](#shared-output) in the blockchain when the ASP broadcast his [round transaction](#round-transaction).

The **VTXO script** is the last level of the [VTXO tree](#vtxo-tree). It should appear on-chain only if the VTXO owner decided to unilaterally exit the Ark. It has 2 tapscript closures:

1. **Redeem** lets to spend the VTXO onchain after a CSV delay. the delay prevents the ASP to lost a VTXO spent off-chain.
2. **Forfeit** expects both parties (owner and ASP) to sign the spending transaction. It is used to spend the VTXO off-chain.

| Boarding or Round transaction | `VTXO script` |

### VTXO Tree

VTXOs are created by a [shared output](#shared-output). This output is enforcing the value to be splitted into a binary tree of other scripts.

![An image from the static](/img/vtxo-tree.png)

_Each node of the diagram is a taproot script._

### Shared output

- Represents a tree of virtual transactions on the blockchain
- In an optimistic scenario, this tree is never revealed
- Each leaf on this tree represents a [VTXO](#vtxo)

A shared output is a bitcoin transaction output locked by a taproot script with 2 tapscript closures:

1. **Unroll** forces the spending transaction format. The tx creates the next level of the script tree on-chain. Splitting the value into 2 outputs with the children taproot scripts.
2. **Sweep** lets the Ark Service Provider to spend the whole shared output after a timeout.

- Tree can have a radix higher than 2 (ex: radix 4)

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Transactions

:::note
In an optimistic scenario, transactions marked with a **\*** should never hit onchain.

#### Legend

- **Alice**: Alice signature is required
- **ASP**: ASP signature is required
- **cov\*\*(script)**: covenant that forces the spending transaction to have a mandatory first output with the **script**
- **and(Alice,Bob)**: both conditions needed to unlock
- **or(Alice,Bob)**: only one condition needed to unlock

### Boarding transaction

- Alice funds an output that can be **accepted as a VTXO** in a future round
- A covenant forces the creation of an output with the same script as [**VTXO**](#vtxo). No need for interactivity after funding it, anyone can spend.
- **ASP** can unlock after a timeout ie. _4 weeks_
- Alice is **required to be online** to maintain access to funds: after the timeout, ASP becomes the only owner funds

| Inputs       | Outputs                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alice‚Äôs UTXO | `(ASP after 4w) or cov((Alice + ASP) or (Alice after 24h))` |

### Forfeit transaction

- Insurance for the ASP, in case Alice tries to double spend her VTXO after spending it inside Ark
- Before the ASP funds Bob‚Äôs VTXO in the next Round transaction, he must receive this transaction signed by Alice
- Uses a connector from the next Round transaction to achieve atomicity

| Inputs                               | Outputs |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| VTXO spending `Alice + ASP`          | `ASP`   |
| Connector from next Round transaction |

### Round transaction

- Funded by the ASP, creates VTXOs
- Has at least two outputs:
  - A shared output with a VTXOs tree
  - A connectors output with a connectors tree
- A new transaction is broadcasted every 5 seconds

| Inputs   | Outputs           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| ASP UTXO | Shared output     |
|          | Connectors output |
